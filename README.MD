# Hey, Welcome!

Hello welcome to my GitHub Profile!  

I love working with computers, both in hardware and in software (proficient in both Windows & Linux), and electronics as well.
In terms of hobbies, I quite like messing with Mod Trackers like OpenMPT, and doing stuff with Inkscape, Aseprite, and LaTeX. I also like games, mainly on PC.

- [RoboÉireann](https://roboeireann.maynoothuniversity.ie/)

## General Programming Areas

- I've done Machine Learning for RoboÉireann for its Ready Gesture detection, and Whistle Detection.
- Low level programming on PIC microcontrollers and Xilinx FPGAs such as the Digilent Zybo, and the AMD KR260 Robotics Kit.
- Bash scripting for automated tasks on my computer and for the stuff above.

## Languages I've used Before

- System Languages: C/C++ (C99 is my favourite)
- Scripting Languages: Lua, Python, Bash, MATLAB
- HDLs: Verilog (though I've tried learning some of System Verilog concepts)
- Document Formatting: LaTeX, Typst (LaTeX for general use, but I've been using Typst more recently)
